CASE ID: {case_id}

EXECUTE THESE QUERIES IN ORDER:

<execute>
SELECT Id, Status, OwnerId, ClosedDate, Priority, Description 
FROM Case 
WHERE Id = '{case_id}'
</execute>

After getting case details, check:

<execute>
SELECT Field__c, OldValue__c, NewValue__c, CreatedDate 
FROM CaseHistory__c 
WHERE CaseId__c = '{case_id}'
ORDER BY CreatedDate
</execute>

Then search for relevant policies:

<execute>
SELECT Id, Title, FAQ_Answer__c 
FROM Knowledge__kav 
WHERE (Title LIKE '%case%close%' 
    OR Title LIKE '%response%time%'
    OR Title LIKE '%escalation%'
    OR Title LIKE '%assignment%')
</execute>

ANALYSIS STEPS:
1. Was case closed without resolution? Check if Status='Closed' but no solution in Description
2. Were there improper owner changes? Check CaseHistory__c for multiple reassignments
3. Did response time exceed policy? Check CreatedDate vs first response
4. Match any violations to Knowledge article IDs
